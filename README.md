<h2 align="left"> 2. Module Functionalities</h2>


### a) **Exercise Video Library**

For clients, this section provides easily available orthopedic workouts. Doctors can give specific exercises for their patients and follow video instructions.

- **Key Features**:
    - Search and filter under actual part, difficulty, etc.
    - embedded from organizations providing video hosting (including YouTube, Vimeo)
    - The doctor assigned a patient whose behavior
    - Track allocated projects using start and finish dates.
    - Completing tests and monitoring development

---

### b) **Progress Tracker**

Patients can track their healing using this gadget. Patients enter range of motion, frequency of completed exercise, degree of pain. Review of this material lets doctors adjust their course of treatment.

- **Key Features**:
    - range of motion; more precisely flexion and extension; patient generated
    - Track degree of pain 0–10 scale
    - Track your exercises either daily or monthly.
    - Graphical reports for medical practitioners keeping track on development
    - System of patient comments or concerns distribution.
    - Automated patient reminders to track development

---

### c) **Remote Consultation (Video Calls)**

This module helps clinicians to assess patient healing and provide advice without personally visiting by means of remote video conferences between patients and doctors.

- **Key Features**:
    - safe webRTC for Zoom API video conferencing integration
    - arrange conferences online.
    - File dissemination, more especially reports, x-rays, in-session chat tool for decision to record meetings for upcoming usage
    - End-to- end encrypted promises perfect communication.

---

### d) **Appointment Scheduling**

This function allows patients' assigned orthopedic specialist to schedule online or in-person conferences.

- **Key Features**:
    - See rapid doctor accessibility.
    - Create a schedule and book of meetings.
    - Notes and warnings when approaching meetings
    - Resuling and cancelation instruments
    - Medical histories and notes about patients

---

### e) **Doctor-Patient Messaging**

a safe messaging system allowing asynchronous debate between doctors and patients about course of treatment, exercise programs, or follow-up queries.

- **Key Features**:
    - Patients text their assigned physician.
    - prescriptions, test results, file sharing, or otherwise
    - Instant alerts for recently arrived messages
    - Search power and message historical performance
    - HIPAA Compliance Based on Safe Data Encryption


---

<h2 align="left"> 3. Development Considerations</h2>

- **Security**: All patient and doctor interactions (appointments, consultations, messaging) must be HIPAA-compliant, ensuring the protection of sensitive health data.
- **Scalability**: The app should support large numbers of patients and doctors, especially when incorporating video consultations, requiring efficient server scaling.
- **API Integration**: Integration with video conferencing APIs (e.g., Zoom, WebRTC) and possibly external exercise databases for a rich library of guided therapy.
- **Push Notifications**
